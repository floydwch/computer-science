## About

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In the future, more categories and/or courses will be added to this list or a more advanced/specialized list.

Initially, we will also give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) type of courses because those courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

## Becoming an OSS student

To officially register for this course you must create a profile in our [students profile](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science-and-engineering/issues/109) issue.

> **"How can I do this?"**

Comment in [this](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science-and-engineering/issues/109) issue  (please, do **not** open a new one) using the following template:

```
- **Name**: YOUR NAME
- **GitHub**: [@your_username]()
- **Twitter**: [@your_username]()
- **Linkedin**: [link]()
- **Website**: [yourblog.com]()

## Completed Courses

**Name of the Section**

Course|Files
:--|:--:
Course Name| [link]()
```

**IMPORTANT**: add your profile **only once** and **after** you **finish** each course you can **return** to that issue and **update** your comment.

**ps**: In the *Completed Courses* section, you should link the repository that contains the files that you created in the respective course.

> **"Why should I do this?"**

By making a [public commitment](http://renewablewealth.com/articles/the-power-of-a-public-commitment/), we have a greater chance of **successfully** graduating, a way to get to know our peers better, and an opportunity to share the things that we have done.

That is why we are using this strategy.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the **Introduction** section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!

### Duration of the project

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular CS course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

> See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

### How can I track/show my progress?

To **track** your progress, you should update the profile that you created and add the courses that you began or ended.

To **show** your progress, you should create a repository on GitHub to put all of the files that you created for each course.

You can create one repository per course, or just one repository that will contain all of the files for each course. The first option is our preferred approach.

**ps**: You should share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! But is quite difficult to manage a large base of students with specific projects. Use our channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects.

### Which programming languages should I use?

My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use **any** language that you want to complete the courses.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Be creative!

This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate. **And this is what really matters**!

In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.
- **Real projects**: you can try to develop at least **one real project** for each course that you enroll. It doesn't need to be a big project, just a **small one** to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge. Some project suggestions [here](https://github.com/karan/Projects) and [here](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs).

### Stay tuned

[Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) this repository for futures improvements and general information.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

**ps**: You don't need to do all of the courses. Just pick one and learn the basics because you will learn more on the go!

## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.

You can also fork this project and fix any mistakes that you have found.

Let's do it together! =)
